key points:

1 - left and right numbers (separated by spaces) to be treated as separate lists
2 - lists must be sorted from smallest to largest number
3 - each item on left list must be compared to corresponding entry on right list to find the difference between them.
4 - all differences, once found, must be added up to produce the solution
